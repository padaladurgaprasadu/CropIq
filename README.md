# CropIq - Soil-Based Crop Recommendation System
CropIq is a machine learning-based crop recommendation system designed to assist farmers and agricultural planners in selecting suitable crops based on soil characterstics derived from satellite images and user location.

The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze soil image patterns and predicts the most appropriate crop for a given region. It aims to improve agricultural productivity by providing data-driven crop suggestions instead of relying solely on traditional farming methods.

Currently, the system focuses on model training, location fetching, and preparation for Android integration. The trained machine learning model has been successfully converted into TensorFlow Lite format for future deployment in a mobile application.

# Objectives

##Android app workflow
In CropIQ machine learning implementation we used static satellite images which are collected from sentinel hub satellite
In Android app we used Google maps API keys to get better location details from the user
Also we used Gemini API to predict the soil types based on the user locations and as well as it will also predict the weather patterns for two weeks early

In android app users are not allowed to upload any images from their gallery we developed location based crop recommendaton system to protect the user data and also privacy issues
